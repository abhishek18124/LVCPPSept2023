/*

Given a string of length n, generate all of its subsequences.

A subsequence of a given string (sequence) is a string (sequence) that is generated by
removing zero or more characters from the given string (sequence) without changing its
order.

Example

	Input : inp[] = "abc"
	Output: ["", "c", "b", "bc", "a", "ac", "ab", "abc"]

Constraints

  1 < n < 10

#include<iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

	char inp[] = "abc";
	char out[10];

	// todo ...

	return 0;
}
