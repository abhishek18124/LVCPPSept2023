/*

Given two strings s1 and s2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters
(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example :

	Input : s1 = "ATGC", s2 = "AGCT"
	Output: 3
	Explanation : "AGC" is the LCS between s1 and s2

	Input : s1 = "AGGTAB", s2 = "GXTXAYB"
	Output: 4
	Explanation : “GTAB” is the LCS between s1 and s2
